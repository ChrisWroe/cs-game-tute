h3 What is a text editor?
p.
    You are probably taught at school about writing documents using something 
    like Microsoft Word. They are called WYSIWYG editors (What you see is what you get). If you want text
     to appear a certain way you select that text and select a menu option to change its appearence
     right in front of you. Behind the scenes, the program is storing extra information in the file 
     about how the words should appear but you don't see that extra information. 
p.
    In a text editor, you
      can't change how individual words look. What you see is all the information stored in the file. 
     Text editors are useful for editing files that contain instructions for the computer rather than 
     instructions for people. This text was written in a text editor called <a href="http://macromates.com">
      TextMate</a> on a Mac. Another text editor for the Mac I have used is 
     <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>.
      On Windows I have used <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
h3 Languages of the Web
p.
    First of all, I need to explain a bit about computer languages. Computers aren't clever enough to
    understand the languages we speak like English or French. We have to use simplified languages. The Web
    is made up of three of these.
dl
    dt HTML
    dd
        p.
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the language we use for describing what text, 
            pictures, and buttons appear on a web page. Markup languages are languages for text documents 
            where additional instructions to the computer are added with tags. Tags are usually written 
            with angle brackets '<>'. One goes at the start of the tag and one at the end. So a tag may look
            like this <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Tags are usually used to go before and after some text to change
             the way it looks. The first is called the opening tag and the second is called the closing tag. They 
             will have the same name but the closing tag will have a forward slash before it. 
             <code>&lt;b&gt; I would be shown with bold text &lt;/b&gt;</code> like <b>this</b>. 
         p.
             A lot of the time tags can appear within other tags. So for example a list is surrounded by a
              <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag. Before the closing <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> tag there will be some 
              <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags for each item in the list. 
         p.
             It is important to
             know that tags can also have names (or ids), and belong to classes. Just like you have a name and belong to 
             a class at school. Well tags actually can belong to more than one class but only have one name. To say the name and 
             which classes a tag belongs to you use tag attributes. 
             <code>&lt;p id="Bill" class="important warning"&gt;</code>. That says the tag has name Bill, and belongs
             to the important and warning classes. The closing tag doesn't need the same information. These names and 
             classes are needed for the next language CSS.
             <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3C Schools</a> have lots more information on HTML.
    dt CSS
    dd.
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. If HTML is used to say what should appear on a web page, css says
        how it should appear. That means both the colour and sizes of text and the background, but also where 
        different blocks of text appear on the page. They use the names and classes of tags I showed you just know
         to pick out which tags to describe. It does this using 'selectors'. This is like team captains selecting 
         out players for their teams. Each team of tags is then given a specific instruction such as 'be red'.<br> 
         <code>.warning {color:red;} </code>. This says make all tags in the warning class red. Classes are 
         selected using '.'. Names (ids) are selected using the '#'.<br>
         <code>#Bill {background-color:blue;} </code>. This says make the tag with the name (id) 'Bill' be blue. Go to 
         <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3C Schools</a> for more information on CSS.
    dt JavaScript
    dd
        p.
            JavaScript turns a web page from some boring text in to something that you can play. It tells the computer
             what to do if you push buttons. For example <code> alert('Hello'); </code> would pop up a little box 
             saying Hello. Go to 
             <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3C Schools</a> for more information on JavaScript.
p.
    To make these languages a bit easier to work with as humans, some people have come along and developed easier 
    (in my opinion) versions to work with and given them different names:
dl
    dt Jade
    dd
        p.
            Jade is called a templating language. It lets you write HTML in a simpler way. You don't have to use the 
            angle brackets or closing tags. To show that one tag should be within another tag you put it on the next
            line indented using the tab key.
        pre
            code.
                html  
                    head 
                    body
                        ol 
                            li The first item in the list
        p.
            The id and name attributes are used so often they can be written using a '#' before the id and a '.' before
            each class (as with CSS selectors). 
        pre
            code.
                p#Bill.important.warning
        p.
            The div tag is used so often in html with classes and an id that it can appear even without a name.
        pre
            code.
                .important.warning
    dt Stylus
    dd
        p.
            Stylus is a similar simplification of CSS. Rather than use curly brackets, colons, and semicolons
             you put the selector on one line and the instructions for the team on the following lines indented
             by one tab key.
        pre
            code.
                #Bill
                    color Blue
    dt CoffeeScript
    dd
        p.
            CoffeeScript is an easier to write version of JavaScript. Again you have to use less brackets, curly brackets,
            and semicolons.
          pre
            code.
                alert 'Hello'
h3 Putting it together
p.
    In the installation instructions you came across a tool called <a href="http://brunch.io">brunch</a>. 
    We use this tool to take the files we have written in jade, stylus, and coffeescript and
    translate it in to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
p I've put the jade files in:
pre
    code app/jade-doc
p For example this web page is written in jade and I've put it here:
pre
    code app/jade-doc/adventure-ex1.jade
p I've put the stylus file here:
pre
    code app/jade-doc/application.styl
p.
    I haven't added any coffeescript files yet. To make it a bit simpler I've just put the coffeescript 
    in the jade file after the following bit of magic:
pre
    code :coffeescript
