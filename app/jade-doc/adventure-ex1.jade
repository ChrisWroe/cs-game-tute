                        | This first step shows you the basics of the game. There is an area where the game
                        | tells you what is happening. At the bottom is a box in which you can type in instructions.
                        | Next to it is a button which if you click will tell the character to do that thing.
                    p
                        | It is basic at the moment. If you press the button it just repeats that text in the box 
                        | above it.
