An experiment in teaching my kids to program adventure games in coffee script. 

### CoffeeScript

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) is a fun language that translates in to JavaScript. JavaScript is less fun to me but is the language used in web browsers, and everything seems to be done in a web browser these days. I could teach my kids about programming using Python which is a popular starting language but the immediate results in a web page seem appealing to me.

### Why and adventure game

My kids have spent a fair amount of time making up adventure games on paper and understand the idea. Transferring it in to a text based program seems like it may be a useful way to get the concepts of programming and possibly web based programming. My plan is to do it as a collection of simple exercises each showing one more feature. 

## Installation

Install node.js from the [website](http://nodejs.org/). node.js lets you run JavaScript outside a web browser. We wont be writing our programs in JavaScript but will rely on it in the background.

Install [brunch](http://brunch.io) by typing the following in a console.

    npm install -g brunch

We may also need CoffeeScript in the background (not sure)

    npm install -g coffeescript
    
Starting from scratch is hard, so there is some code already here in this github project. As I finish each exercise I'll post the exercise starting and complete example code.
